# How to contribute

Here are some important resources:

  * [Reporting bugs](https://github.com/thebridsk/bridgescorer/issues/new)
  * [Issues](https://github.com/thebridsk/bridgescorer/issues/new)
  * [ZenHub](https://app.zenhub.com/workspaces/5a57e97a310d044aa9b372d2/boards?repos=117162545)

## Testing

Scalatest using FlatSpec is used for testing.  All changes SHOULD have test coverage.

## Submitting changes

Please send a [GitHub Pull Request to bridgescorer](https://github.com/thebridsk/bridgescorer/pull/new/master) with a clear list of what you've done (read more about [pull requests](http://help.github.com/pull-requests/)). When you send a pull request, please be sure to add test cases. Please follow the coding convention in the files and make sure all of your commits are atomic (one feature per commit).

Always write a clear log message for your commits. One-line messages are fine for small changes, but bigger changes should look like this:

    $ git commit -m "A brief summary of the commit
    > 
    > A paragraph describing what changed and its impact."

## Coding conventions

Start reading our code and you'll get the hang of it. We optimize for readability:

  * We indent using two spaces (soft tabs)
  * This is open source software. Consider the people who will read your code, and make it look nice for them. It's sort of like driving a car: Perhaps you love doing donuts when you're alone, but with passengers the goal is to make the ride as smooth as possible.

Thanks,
The Bridge Scorekeeper
